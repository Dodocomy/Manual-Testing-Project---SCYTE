# Manual-Testing-Project---SCYTE

<h1>Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course</h1>

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge the course and apply them in practice, using a live  application.

Application under test: [Application Name]()

API Documentation:

<strong>The final project will be split into 2 sections: [Testing section]() and [SQL section](). </strong>

Tools used: 

<h1>Functional specifications</h1>

<h2>1.1 Test planning</h2>

The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for the X module for the <em>Application name</em>.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan.

<h3>1.1.1 Roles assigned to the project and persons allocated</h3>
<h3>1.1.2 Entry criterea defined</h3>
<h3>1.1.3 Exit criteria defined</h3>
<h3>1.1.4 Test scope</h3>

- Product risks:
<h3>1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria</h3>
The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achived and the test process can continue.
<h2>1.2 Test Monitoring and Control</h2>
It will be done by generating periodic reports that reflect the current status of the test.
<h2>1.3 Test Analysis</h2>
The testing process will be executed on the above requirements for the <em>module to be tested</em>. The following test conditions were found:
